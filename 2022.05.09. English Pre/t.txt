Hello everyone, considering that more or less everyone here is related to computers and also enjoying the convenience of machine learning technology, today we  are going to bring you a demonstration about machine learning.
-----
P1:
First, please focus on the defination of machine learning. First please take a look at this. 

-----
P2:
In this defination, the E is the Experience, and the T is the Task, and the P refer to the Performance Measure.

And when it comes to the this scenario: 

Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather data, and have it learn to predict weather. In this setting, what is E?
Emmm, seems no one tend to answer it, so I'm going to explain it.
In this setting, T is the weather prediction task, and the P is the probability of it correctly predicting a future date's weather, and the E points to the process of the algorithm examining a large amount of historical weather data.

P3:
Emmm... A little bit complex and awkward, and here comes some more frienfly definations of Machine Learning.

-----
P4:
Maybe you don't particularly understand machine learning yet, come on, let me find some real-world scenarios.

P1:
Now let's me invite you the practical application of the machine learning.

-----
P2:
Aren't you familiar with Self-Driving? How do they do it? Is there a read man behind controlling your car like a remote-controlled one? Have you not used face ID yet?
