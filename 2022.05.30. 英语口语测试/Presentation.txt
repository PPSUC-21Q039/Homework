How can we get along well with others?

Humans are social beings, and we enjoy being treated well. So getting along well with others is absolutely about treating people with respect and care. And here I'd like to share with you some valuable tips.

The first is to be a good listener. To start a conversation, it is essential to listen first. Never indulge yourself in instant chat without any preparation. 

Also, keep your sense of humor. A little laughter goes a long way, and a smile eases tensions. Some frictions can be quickly defused by not being too serious, and you can also leave others a good impression by this.

Last is being helpful to others. It could be as simple as bringing in some little things for people or offering help to someone struggling to carry something. This could show your care about others, making people want to be around you. 

Tips are easy to conclude, but we still need to exercise ourselves to make effective changes to integrate theory with practice. I hope we can keep a good relationship with the people around us.
