How can we get along well with others?

Humans are social beings, and we enjoy being treated well. So getting along well with others, is absolutely about treating people with respect and care. And here I'd like to share you some useful tips.

First is to be a good listener. To start a conversation, it is important to listen first. Never indulge yourself in instant chat without any preparation. 

Also, keep your sense of humor. A little laughter goes a long way, and a smile eases tensions. Some frictions can be easily defused by not being too serious, and you can also leave others a good impression by this.

Last, do things for others. It could be as simple as bringing in some little things for people or offering help to someone who is struggling to carry something. This could show your care about other people and this will make people want to be around you. 

Tips are easy to conclude, but to really do it, we still need to exercise ourselves to make effective changes. Hope all of us can keep a good relationship with people around us.
