True Meaning of Sportsmanship

Sportsmanship, also sporting spirit, usually refers to virtues that mainly consist of fairness, care, courage, and persistence, and is highly recommended in all kinds of sports competitions. 

In a game, sportsmanship is needed most because it requires the sportsmen to be not only self-controlled enough to obey the rules but also take care of their opponents. Especially when the gap between the two sides is high, the stronger side should never keep pursuing the weaker, or the game will not be peaceful and meaningful.

However, the less strong side should also not give up at first just because he's more likely to be defeated. Fighting bravely to challenge is another important part of Sportsmanship. Maybe you will be beaten and get injured, maybe you have to accept the truth that you are weaker, but you should never accept it before the competition starts. Nothing is impossible.

The word Sportsmanship contains a lot, and only when a man competes with it can he become a true sportsman. We respect it in all ways!
