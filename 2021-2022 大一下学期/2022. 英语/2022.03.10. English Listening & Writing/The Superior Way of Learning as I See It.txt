In my humble opinion, the superior way of learning is to learn by one's self all the time in the process of handling other things.
Learning is a way of strengthening one's own abilities to solve many kinds of problems, which one has never challenged before, and only through trying to solve them by his own hands can he really figure them out and absorbed the unique experience of solving other similar problems. We are always meeting all kinds of problems and are always trying to solve them. We learn from them and learn to settle them down. There are tens of thousand ways to learn, and I strongly suggest learning by solving them step by step. Not only it is beneficial to widen one's breadth of knowledge to do this, but it can also help you improve the abilities to solve real-world issues. It may be painful, and it may take a lot of time to complete a job without any assistance, but with such pains that you have suffered, you gain abilities. 
Methods of learning vary a lot, but what I love most is to seek help from search engines. We have Wikipedia, we have Wikihow, and we have Google and many other online sevices to use. It's of vital importance to broaden our horizons, and through search engines we can gain a lot of other information associated with the knowledge itself. Although it's a fast way, you should notice that it does no help to the depth, so you shouldn't rely everything on it. Only when balanced, it can be fast and efficient.
All in all, I value this way of learning, and I see it as a superior way to learn new knowledge.
