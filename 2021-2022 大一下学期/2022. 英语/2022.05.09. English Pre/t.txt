Hello everyone, considering that more or less everyone here is related to computers and also enjoying the convenience of machine learning technology, today we  are going to bring you a demonstration about machine learning.
-----
P1:
First, please focus on the defination of machine learning. First please take a look at this. 

-----
P2:
In this defination, the E is the Experience, and the T is the Task, and the P refer to the Performance Measure.
念PPT
/*
And when it comes to the this scenario: 

Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather data, and have it learn to predict weather. In this setting, what is E?
Emmm, seems no one tend to answer it, so I'm going to explain it.
In this setting, T is the weather prediction task, and the P is the probability of it correctly predicting a future date's weather, and the E points to the process of the algorithm examining a large amount of historical weather data.

P3:
Emmm... A little bit complex and awkward, and here comes some more frienfly definations of Machine Learning.

-----
P4:
Maybe you don't particularly understand machine learning yet, come on, let me find some real-world scenarios.

P1:
Now let's me invite you the practical application of the machine learning.


-----
P2:
Aren't you familiar with Self-Driving? How do they do it? Is there a read man behind controlling your car like a remote-controlled one? 

And, have you not used face ID yet? I believe this can bring you a lot of convenience, but did you ever think of the technology that is applied behind? The face recognition is a technology that typically uses machine learning, by learning your faces.

Then, did you notice that your message application can detect and block some spam messages? Do they just recognize by comparing the incoming phone number?

Also, this technology can be applied to credit card fraud detection. The model can compare the behavior of the card user with the database, for example, if the position and the kinds of goods changed in a very short period of time, then it is very likely to be stolen brushed.

Besides, I believe most of you are using or have used voice recognition, right? When somebody send you a wechat message, and it's not convenient for you to listen at once, what will you do? It must be: Transfer to text!


-----
P3:
To speak more, it comes to Computer Vision, also CV, and what are used most must be the OCR technology, Optical Character Recognition. By OCR Technology, you can easily transfer the texts in the pictures into the pure texts. Besides, the self-driving and face-recognition technology are also using CV. Through this, the computer can try to understand the picture it self, and parse the meaning of the vision.

P4:
Actually, the concept of machine learning has been carried almost seventy years ago, but why is it only now becoming popular? For one thing, it is because the application of Big Data, for anotoher thing, it is because of the massive computer power and better algorithms. Why is MASSIVE? Because only our mobile phone, can beat most of the supersomputers in the nineteen eighties, and you can easily create a model by using some existing repositories.

Machine Learning has applications that are far beyound our imagination. It is not a high-level technology, instead, it is walking into our lives and contributing to our world!
