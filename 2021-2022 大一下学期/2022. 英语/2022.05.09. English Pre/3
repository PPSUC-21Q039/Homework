Now let me introduce you the fundamentals of machine learning.

First it comes to some very confuing concepts, AI, the Artificial Interlligence, Machine learning and deep learning. These are different ones, but are also related in some aspects. Between them is a relationship of inclusion.

From this slide you can also find that they are developing, from the early artificial intelligence, step by step, to the modern deep learning. The algorithm are becoming more efficient and more effective, and are also costing less materials that are used to feed the model.
