# The Urgent Condition of Retaining Traditional Culture

With the rapid spread of globalization and other Western and modern cultures, our traditional cultures are facing a huge danger of being abandoned or replaced. Protecting the intangible cultural heritage is now an urgent problem for such a country with 56 different ethnic groups! 

We are all a part of the Chinese nation and are also the maintainers and creators of our long-standing culture. We inherited it from our ancestors, and can not let it go away. The threats of alien cultures are unimaginable, and many of us are even not aware! Foreign goods are being sold all around the country, with foreign thoughts spreading widely, and foreign festivals are also being celebrated. This should never happen in China, for it's eroding our traditions and is trying to split our land into several pieces subtly.

The situation is serious and great importance should be attached to protecting our culture from being affected and invaded. These are efforts of tens of thousands of generations, and more attention should be drawn to the importance of protecting them well.
